This directory contains the following examples:

basic.c:		Demonstrates how to create a relation and how to access
				separate entries.
				
dsl.c
Hamilton.prog:	Creates a random homogeneous relation (a graph), loads an
				external file in the domain-specific programming language (DSL)
				and computes a Hamilton path for the graph. Optionally, the
				result is written to a file in DOT (Graphviz) format.
				
				Demonstrates the following:
					* Create a random relation
					* Use the GNU MP arbitrary size integers with Kure2.
					* Create a Lua state.
					* Load a file containing DSL code into it.
					* Load an existing relation into it.
					* Execute a DSL expression.

dsl_to_lua.c: 	Given some input files in the domain-specific programming
				language it generates Lua code for them.
				
				Demonstrates how to parse a file with DSL code and how to use
				the parser callbacks (KureParserObserver).
